# Challenges Faced & Soltuions

## Web-App
I was unfamiliar with state management beyond useState, so using something like TanStack Query was new to me. The main challenge I faced was getting used to the different options for refetching like staleTime and refetchInterval. However, once I read the docs for a bit and learned what each option did, it wasn't too troublesome. 

## Docusaurus
Before this project, Docusaurus was completely new to me. I didn't know which type of page to use or how to anchor an element to navigate to a different page. I also had a lot of trouble figuring out how to make a markdown page the root of the website. After reading the docs, watching videos, and learning how the hiearchy works, it was pretty intuitive.
